    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Writing Poetry has not always been something that I would do in my leisure time or at times when 
        I am stressed but it has been a friend since covid times. I agree I don't write like a professional
        poet would but it helps me deal with life in so many ways. I have written multiple poems many of 
        which were praised by my peers and acquaintances. Writing down what I am feeling in words has 
        helped me in may different ways. It made me more aware of what I really am, what I expect from
        other people, and how I expect to act myself.A few of the poems I have written are shown below.

            <h3>"He Is There"</h3>

            <p>
                There she stands in all her glory, hiding her own story.<br/>
                Afraid of the lingering eyes, as her breath fall and rise.<br/>
                Her smile on display, that suited the role she had to play. <br/>
                Her sweet words, that made everyone’s temper to curb.<br/>
                Watching her father’s eyes, she swears she would have cried.<br/> 
                He knew she was faking; he knew she was inside breaking.<br/> 
                His smile made her feel relieved, “He is there” she believed.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                There she sat with her heart at pain, all her efforts were vain. <br/>
                Her heart wrenching sobs were audible, pushing that out of her thoughts 
                seemed impossible. <br/>
                She was now her true self, the one even she hated herself. <br/>
                She was a weakling, and all her feelings didn’t help her in healing.<br/>
                All the words still rung in her mind, why is she the one everyone is behind??<br/>
                A hand landed on her shoulder, “I am her for you” the possessor of the hand 
                told her. <br/>
                He knew she felt weak, he knew why she will never speak.<br/> 
                His embrace made her feel secured, “he is there” she was assured.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>
                There she is trying to fly, wishing to experience everything before she dies.<br/> 
                Her eyes still void, but she was no more annoyed. <br/>
                She still cries, though not after every sun rise. <br/>
                Her smile was there, and it wasn’t fake everybody was aware. <br/>
                She loved herself, no more worrying about who said “you should change yourself...”<br/> 
                His hand was in her grip, her true polite words that spill out her lips.<br/>
                His hold was her strength, “he is there” made her feel content. <br/>

            <h3>"Angels Aren't Real"</h3>

            <p>
                In the blue sky with the wings open wide<br/> 
                There is the angel that survived <br/>
                Bloodshed, war and tears of sorrow.<br/>
                But never turned down her hope narrow. <br/>
                She kept this all in her till now <br/>
                Because she was angel and having emotions was not allowed.
            </p>
            <p>
                There she is now flying so high With a triumph smile held in pride.<br/> 
                But still, she is incomplete Finding for the soul she feels <br/>
                Is around but never seen <br/>
                And is far from what is reality.<br/> 
                A soul who is busy chasing his own dreams<br/>
                She felt hurt but never showed <br/>
                Because she was an angel and was the one to hold all the load. 
            </p>
            <p>
                She is still there trying <br/> 
                With her eyes filled with the little whines. <br/>
                The whines that she was never supposed to suppress.<br/>
                But she was an angel and can’t object.
            </p>
            <p>
                All her hope came tumbling back <br/>
                When all her dreams were thrown down the rack <br/>
                By the only soul who she wanted to have her back<br/> 
                Who she thought was always stay <br/>
                Was just a false hope of the ray <br/>
                But she was an angel <br/>
                and staying quite was the only way.
            </p>
            <p> 
                She took her time to learn it all again<br/> 
                Because she was an angel and not allowed to show her pain.<br/> 
                Her lips started curving up again <br/>
                Because all her pain just made her gains<br/> 
                There is she now with her head actually held up high<br/> 
                Because she is the only one in sky.<br/>
                The soul is now an old chapter<br/>
                Whose existence is no longer her matter. She is free to laugh and smile <br/>
                After travelling the rough road for miles. <br/>
                The road that led her here today<br/> 
                And she can confidently say <br/>
                Whatever she feels Whatever is real <br/>
                Because she now knows that <strong>“Angels are not real”</strong>.
