                        When Elsie Porter meets Ben Ross on a rainy New Year's Day, their chemistry 
                        is instant and electric. Within weeks, the two are head over heels in love. 
                        By May, they've eloped.Only nine days later, Ben is out riding his bike when 
                        he is hit by a truck and killed on impact. At the hospital, Elsie must face 
                        Susan, the mother-in-law she has never met—and who doesn't even know Elsie 
                        exists.Interweaving Elsie and Ben's charmed romance with Elsie and Susan's 
                        healing process, Forever, Interrupted will remind you that there's more 
                        than one way to find a happy ending.

                        At the age of twenty-nine, Hannah Martin still has no idea what she wants 
                        to do with her life. Shortly after moving back to her hometown of Los 
                        Angeles, she goes out to a bar with her best friend, Gabby, and reconnects 
                        with her high school boyfriend, Ethan. Just after midnight, she is offered 
                        a ride home by each of them.What happens if she leaves with Gabby?What 
                        happens if she leaves with Ethan?As these two alternate realities run their 
                        course, Maybe in Another Life raises questions about fate and true love: 
                        Is anything meant to be? How much in our life is determined by chance? 
                        And perhaps, most compellingly: Is there such a thing as a soul mate?

                        When Lauren and Ryan's marriage reaches the breaking point, they decide to take
                        a year off in the hopes of finding a way to fall in love again. There is only 
                        one rule: they cannot contact each other. Aside from that, anything goes.
                        After I Do is a love story about what happens when the love fades. It's 
                        about staying in love, seizing love, forsaking love, and committing to love 
                        with everything you've got.It's the story of a couple caught up in an old 
                        game—and searching for a new road to happily ever after.
