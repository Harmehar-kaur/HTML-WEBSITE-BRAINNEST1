                        Lily hasn't always had it easy, but that's never stopped her from working hard for the life she 
                        wants. She's come a long way from the small town in Maine where she grew up—she
                        graduated from college, moved to Boston, and started her own business. So when 
                        she feels a spark with a gorgeous neurosurgeon named Ryle Kincaid, everything 
                        in Lily's life suddenly seems almost too good to be true. Ryle is assertive, stubborn, maybe even a little arrogant.He's also sensitive, 
                        brilliant, and has a total soft spot for Lily. Lily can't get him out of her head. But Ryle's complete
                        aversion to relationships is disturbing. Even as Lily finds herself becoming the
                        exception to his “no dating” rule, she can't help but wonder what made him that 
                        way in the first place.As questions about her new relationship overwhelm her, 
                        so do thoughts of Atlas Corrigan.He was her kindred spirit, her protector. When Atlas suddenly 
                        reappears, everything Lily has built with Ryle is threatened.

                        Lily and her ex-husband, Ryle, have just settled into a civil coparenting 
                        rhythm when she suddenly bumps into her first love, Atlas, again. After 
                        nearly two years separated, she is elated that for once, time is on their 
                        side, and she immediately says yes when Atlas asks her on a date.But her 
                        excitement is quickly hampered by the knowledge that, though they are no 
                        longer married, Ryle is still very much a part of her life—and Atlas 
                        Corrigan is the one man he will hate being in his ex-wife and daughter's 
                        life.Switching between the perspectives of Lily and Atlas, It Starts with 
                        Us picks up right where the epilogue for the “gripping, pulse-pounding” 
                        (Sarah Pekkanen, author of Perfect Neighbors) bestselling phenomenon It 
                        Ends with Us left off. Revealing more about Atlas's past and following Lily 
                        as she embraces a second chance at true love while navigating a jealous 
                        ex-husband, it proves that “no one delivers an emotional read like Colleen 
                        Hoover” (Anna Todd, New York Times bestselling author).

                        You'll never be able to find yourself if you're lost in someone else.Fallon 
                        meets Ben, an aspiring novelist, the day before her scheduled cross-country 
                        move. Their untimely attraction leads them to spend Fallon's last day in 
                        L.A. together, and her eventful life becomes the creative inspiration Ben 
                        has always sought for his novel. Over time and amidst the various 
                        relationships and tribulations of their own separate lives, they 
                        continue to meet on the same date every year. Until one day Fallon 
                        becomes unsure if Ben has been telling her the truth or fabricating a 
                        perfect reality for the sake of the ultimate plot twist.Can Ben's 
                        relationship with Fallon - and simultaneously his novel - be considered a 
                        love story if it ends in heartbreak?
